Finding out if a developer follows these practices is a decent way to evaluate their work quality without having to know how to code. Browse your dev's GitHub portfolio and find a project that she has released to users (not a little pet project). Then look for these quality clues:</p>\n<h3>Tests</h3>\n<p>Devs write tests to confirm that their code works. Untested code is more likely to contain bugs. Find out if the dev has written tests by clicking though the folders in their GitHub project and looking for one named <strong>tests</strong>. Peek into that folder and make sure there are some files within the test folder. If so, the dev tests her code -- yay! This quick check doesn't confirm that the tests work, but it at least indicates whether she recognizes the value of testing.</p>\n<p>Some projects include icons in the <strong>README.md</strong> file (which is shown on the front-page of a GitHub project) to indicate the code's tests and resiliency. Simply having those buttons is a good enough indication that a dev puts in the effort the maintain code quality.  </p>\n<h3>Pull Requests</h3>\n<p>Pull requests allow devs to safely introduce new code to a project. Without them, it becomes difficult to isolate and replicate issues. Look for the <strong>Pull Requests</strong> tab in their project and make sure it's not empty.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>Working code is often more important than perfect documentation. However, a dev that is willing to put in some effort to document their project makes it easier for users and other developers to get started. To quickly assess whether a dev makes any documentation effort, simply look for the existence of a <strong>README.md</strong> file in their GitHub project (or just scroll down from their main page and see if anything is written). Also look for through <strong>Wiki</strong> section. Read through them and see if you can get a sense of what the project is, how to get started, and what to do if you run into issues.</p>\n<h3>Bonus: Do One Thing*</h3>\n<p>(*This tactic requires some familiarity with reading code)</p>\n<p>Writing code sections that do more than one thing is a cardinal sin. It makes code harder to read and test, which makes it more likely to contain bugs. It also makes it difficult to adapt the code as the project evolves, slowing down development time. To approximate whether a dev has developed this bad habit, open up a few of their files (that don't start with a dot in front of them) and look at the different sections. If they're consistently really big, they likely do more than one thing. </p>"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"how-to-hire-a-good-software-developer-without-knowing-how-to-code-communication","dateSlug":"2020-06-28","postID":"how-to-hire-a-good-software-developer-without-knowing-how-to-code-communication-2020-06-28"},"frontmatter":{"category":"hiring","tags":["non-technical"],"date":"June 28, 2020","format":"image","title":"How To Hire A Good Software Developer (without knowing how to code) - Communication","video_link":null,"quote_text":null,"quote_author":null,"link":null,"author":{"name":"Ty Hitzeman"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/3866d/communication.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/d1bff/communication.jpg 6w,\n/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/3866d/communication.jpg 510w,\n/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/f5836/communication.jpg 1024w","srcWebp":"/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/47cfc/communication.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/ab631/communication.webp 6w,\n/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/47cfc/communication.webp 510w,\n/static/7330c48a658f344c3640f2c198c8547c/5e5ef/communication.webp 1024w","sizes":"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px","presentationWidth":510,"presentationHeight":340}}},"images":null},"excerpt":"Contrary to the stereotype of the reclusive developer who works in isolation, devs constantly communicate with others.

How well they do that can have a bigger impact on your project's success than their technical skills alone. Yet evaluating a dev's communication skills is not as easy as scrolling through a GitHub profile or resume. So, here are some ways how you can quickly assess a developer's communication skills over a short conversation.</p>\n<h4>Find something that you and the dev disagree on and discuss it.</h4>\n<p>How does he express himself? Does he crumble and disregard his opinion after realizing it's different than yours? Does he stubbornly cling to it without hearing your side first? A strong communicator can make his opinions with confidence while staying open to new perspectives.  </p>\n<h4>Role play the optimistic timeline scenario.</h4>\n<p>Ask the dev to pretend that she just realized that the project's scope was larger than she initially expected, and that it'd be impossible to meet the timeline she initially gave. What is her initial response? The best response is to let you know quickly and candidly, so you can adjust scope, reset expectations, and reallocate resources. The worst response would be for the dev to go into hero mode by trying to overcome the problem herself without telling anyone. This might work occasionally, but eventually it won't; You'll find out at the last minute, the dev will be burned out, and everyone else involved will be frustrated that they didn't find out sooner. The difference between a minor setback and complete failure often comes back to a developer's willingness to communicate difficult truths.</p>\n<h4>Prompt Self-Reflection</h4>\n<p>Have him explain a previous conflict and how he handled himself. Ask if he'd do anything different next time. Look for signs of candid, empathetic, proactive communication. Not being able to think of an example might be a sign of conflict avoidance, while an inability to self-reflect might reveal an adversarial communicator.</p>"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"how-to-pick-a-good-software-developer-without-knowing-how-to-code-empathy","dateSlug":"2020-06-27","postID":"how-to-pick-a-good-software-developer-without-knowing-how-to-code-empathy-2020-06-27"},"frontmatter":{"category":"hiring","tags":["non-technical"],"date":"June 27, 2020","format":"quote","title":"How To Pick A Good Software Developer (without knowing how to code) - Empathy","video_link":null,"quote_text":"If the dev doesn't give a shit about you, your product, or your users, don't hire him","quote_author":"Aristotle","link":null,"author":{"name":"Ty Hitzeman"},"image":null,"images":null},"excerpt":"Empathetic developers build for the user, customer, and future maintainers, while apathetic developers build for themselves.

The easiest way to do so is by assessing the developer’s public reputation. Here’s how to find and apply that information.</p>\n<h3>Client Reviews</h3>\n<p>Accessing unfiltered client reviews of a developer (not testimonials) is the best indicator of his/her work quality. If you're using a marketplace like Freelancer, UpWork, or Fiverr, the developer's reviews are easy to find. If not, find those reviews yourself. If you know who the past clients are, reach out to them directly. If not, ask the developer to share their contact information. Focus on the interpersonal rather than technical comments. It's a lot easier to learn a specific tech stack than it is to learn how to communicate effectively. </p>\n<h3>Peer Reviews</h3>\n<p>Developers are hard to please. So, a dev who has built a strong reputation among peers is likely to have solid technical skills. You can find dev reputations on Stack OverFlow and GitHub. </p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a></h4>\n<p>This is a coding-specific Q&#x26;A forum that every developer uses. It's extremely likely that your developer has a Stack OverFlow profile. Find it and look for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relative ranking (top x% overall)</li>\n<li>Total points</li>\n<li>Number questions answered</li>\n<li>Number people reached</li>\n<li>The topics they've worked with.
